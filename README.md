# Helpline-Prototype
This is a solution that i've created for the Google Developer Student Clubs Solution Challenge 2022, The name of the project is Helpline.
This app is made to save your time when there is an emergency.

The way it works is:

1) when you open the app it asks you to enter your name,after which you tap on "continue".
2) There will be a set of instructions that you read on the homepage with 4 buttons that can be clicked.
3) These buttons comprise of the police,ambulance,fire brigade and the emergency services which is the 911 of India.
4) After you select which authorities you want to send your emergency request to,it will ask you to set your location.
5) After setting your location, tap on Yes to send the message and No to return to the menu/homepage.
6) If you tapped Yes, An automated text to speech message will be sent to the requested auhorities.
7) This message will contain your Name,Address and coordinates of your location and will be repeated thrice.

As for now only the basic UI has been created in Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/x3B3jgbfJzYYsQ8IhUPWpe/HELPLINE?node-id=9%3A3) And the app has been made in bravo studio, There is no code for the app because of this reason. 
The working parts of the app are the interactions between buttons and setting your location,Nothing is going to be stored in a database as there isnt any at the moment, If yes is pressed nothing happens as the app hasnt been integrated with the desired code yet, The app is simply a prototype of what is to come.
These are the instructions given on the homepage on the app:
("1)Select which kind of sevice is in need
2)Set your location
3)Confirm by tapping “Yes”


 And that’s it,your emergency request will be 
 sent instantly with an automated voice 
 message, saying your name,address and  
 your coordinates.")
 This is my app prototype Helpline, hope you like it!!!! 
 Thank you.
